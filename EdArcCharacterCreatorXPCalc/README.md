# Character Creator/XP Calculator

Currently in developement, this application is meant to help players create characters when using my
homebrew ruleset for DND 5e. This program was made in C Sharp & XAML using the WPF subsystem that's part of
the .NET framework, & was submitted as a final project for my CSC 260 class at [DSU](https://dsu.edu/).
This project is still unfinished & I continue to work on it in my downtime.

###### Current & Planned Features:

To get an idea of what currently exists in the program at a glance check out my [Functionality Brief] ().
This document was made during the planning stages of the project & should give you a good idea of what exists
& what has yet to be implemented. Within the document you'll notice that items of interest are highlighted.
Objects highlighted in Green are finished, Yellow are in progress, & blank ones are barely started.

###### Future Features:
* __Drag & Drop.__ I want users to be able to organize their Character's as they see fit (WPF has functionality that makes this easy to learn).
* __Application Themes.__ Right now, the program sports a bright modern look, I'd like to make two themes: Dark & Fantasy.
* __Platform Friendly.__ The application only functions on a Windows enviroment. I'd like to create Web & Mobile versions.

## Installation:
NOTE: That at the moment this program has no executables!
